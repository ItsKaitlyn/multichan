# Ikachan+
Updated version of Ikachan with extra features.

Features: 50/60fps options, extra window sizes, and Widescreen

## Compilation
Currently, the only way to compile this project is with the Visual Studio solution. (Visual Studio .NET 2003)

# To-Do
If possible, a portable build of this would be appreciated. I'm not sure how to program, really, so I'd need help porting it to something like SDL2.
